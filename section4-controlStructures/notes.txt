equality operator is a double == 

!= this checks for value inequality 2 == "2" is true

===/!== checks for value and type equality/inequality 2 === '2' is false because value is the same but data type is not

> & < this can be used for numbers and strings(this is checked lexiographically e.g. f is later in the ABC's than a)

>= % <= is another operator

! checks if thing is not true

youre able to nest an if condition within an if condition 

2 objects will always yield a result false when compared even if the key/value pair is the same. The same is true for arrays

the and operator (to require 2 conditions) has a syntax of && and the or operator has the || syntax. You are able to group conditions in parenthesis to group conditions the way that you want them

if you just put return then the following lines of code are not executed

Operator precedence 
Bedmas is followed for mathematical calculations
And operator has a higher precedence than Or


JS tries to convert strings into booleans this is called truty and falsy operators without explicitly stating comparisons

empty strings are treated as false while a non empty string is treated as true ''(false)/'a'(true) if ('') vs if ('a')
number 0 is treated as false while all other positive and negative numbers are equal to true
all objects and arrays are treated as true even if they are empty
Null Undefined and NaN are always treated as false
! mean NOT

Conversion(this converts either implicitly or explicitly) vs coercion (forces to convert to a true/false value: this is done implicitly)

prompt() is a function that asks user for input

isNan is a method that checks whether somthing is a number or not
