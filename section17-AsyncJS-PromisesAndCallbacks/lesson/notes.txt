Js is single threaded meaning it can only execute one thing at a time
This can have a downside that it will take a lond time and you'll have to wait
You can add tasks to the browser and the function is not dependant on the js file
THe browser sends back a callback once the thing occured 

Message queue is when the browser tells the js engine that whenever it has a moment it should execute something
The event loop is the thing that checks the stack if its empty and if it is then it pushes tasks from the message queue to execute
browser controls the event loop
