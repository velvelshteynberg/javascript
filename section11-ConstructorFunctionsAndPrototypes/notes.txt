Constructor functions are also blueprints for objects and have properties and methods too
You can use Constructor functions without being inside of a class. Class is just syntaxical sugar so that
a this object creation Constructor will act different that other functions (will instantiate an object and return the object)
Prototypes are connected objects that are fallback objects
Prototypes are like base classes
Prototype chain. 
This all refers to a property call .__proto__ which JS goes to if it cant find a function and continues going to the all __proto__ until it throws an error. 


constructor functions have a special property call prototype where you can assign default bahaviours and then that
gets checked by JS at the first __proto__ level

This is what the extends key word in Classes does: it assigns the proptotype as another object
