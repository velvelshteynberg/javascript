OOP is an approach of structuring code
1-work with real life entities (using objects)

Classes define blueprints for objects
An instance is an object created from an object
class Product {
    title = 'default';
    imageUrl;
    description;
    price; 
}
new Product(); creates a new instance of this object



Static field/property/method - accesible on the class itself without instantiation
instance field/property/method = accesible only on the instance based on the class

Inheritance is a base class that other items can inherit from
You have to use the key word extends 'Class name' to inherit from another class
If you want to inherit from a parent class one of the methods then you need to use the keyword super()
e.g. fullName() {
    super(); This will inherit from the base class
}
inside a constructor this refers to the object that is being created


_method = 'name'
_ used to be the convention to keep something private but you could get arround that and access it from outside that specific class. 


p instanceof Person will return true if p is an instantiated object based on Person

you could create an object by doing const obj = new Object();

all objects have descriptors
object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(person) will return the getOwnPropertyDescriptors
writable means that you can assign a new value to this key
configurable = you can delete it
enumareble means you can us a for in loop on it
object.defineProperty(person, 'name', {configurable: true, enumerable: true, writable:false})
this is a way to lock properties down
