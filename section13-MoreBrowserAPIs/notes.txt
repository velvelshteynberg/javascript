The dataset read-only property of the HTMLElement interface provides read/write access to custom data attributes ( data-* ) 
on elements. It exposes a map of strings ( DOMStringMap ) with an entry for each data-* attribute. 
Note: The dataset property itself can be read, but not directly written.
Dataset is used to set custom data

You can select an element to work with by selecting an element and then doing $0.
x-axis - left to write
y-axis = top to bottom
$0.getBoundingClientRect() gives you the measurements of the element

$0.offsetTop/left  gives you the height of how much it is offsetTop
.clientTop/left gives you the offset of the box without the margins/scrollbars to the outermost point (I think this means the width of the margin)
.offsetWidth/offsetHeight gives you the width of the entire box

.clientWidth/clientHeight gives you the width/height of the element except for the margin/scrollbars
.scrollHeight gives you the entire height even the non visible height
.scrollTop gives you how much you have scrolled
window.innerWidth/Height gives you the entire width (has drawbacks)
document.documentElement.clientHeight/width (will deduct all scrollbars)
HTMLElement doc on MDN explains all of this
