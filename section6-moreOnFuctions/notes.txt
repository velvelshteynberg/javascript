Parameters are the names for the things that you then go and pass in the argument e.g. paramater is name argument is 'max', 'velvel'

You can have a function in an object. This is called a method. 

AddeventListener is a method attached to an object

Actually functions really are objects in essence console.dir(function) will give you an entire object in the console.

Functions can be stored in variables. e.g. const name = function(){}

Expressions yield returns for you

An anonymous function is one where it doesnt have a name
e.g. const name = function (parameter) {
    console.log(parameter)
}
This is an anonymous function because it doesnt have a name. Anonymous functions are not neccesarily linked to variables. Sometimes you need them if you will not need to reuse the code ever. 


Function declaration/statement is naming the function and not assigning to a variable. THe function gets hoisted to the top and can be used script-wide even if definition has been set after being called. 

Function Expressions (assigning the function to a constant). The constant is hoisted but is set to undefined until the actual definition is ran so therefore the funciton will HAVE TO BE defined before execution 

adding names to functions is always good because this way if you get an error you can see which funciton the browser doesn't like
