event listener you can do on the html element onclick = 'alert('hello')'- strongly discouraged to use this


mouseenter event is when it hovers over an element. relatedtarget property here means the element that the mouse was on before it came onto the button

capturing is from the outside in while bubbling is from the inside outside
with event listeners the browser will always execute all anscestral event listeners too. This is called event propogation
