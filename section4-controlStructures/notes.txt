equality operator is a double == 

!= this checks for value inequality 2 == "2" is true

===/!== checks for value and type equality/inequality 2 === '2' is false because value is the same but data type is not

> & < this can be used for numbers and strings(this is checked lexiographically e.g. f is later in the ABC's than a)

>= % <= is another operator

! checks if thing is not true
