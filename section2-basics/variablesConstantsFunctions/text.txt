ways to run js
1-You can get js loaded by putting stuff in between script tags in html
2- <script src = "assests/script/app.js"></script>- page cant load first. You can put the script tag at the end of the body


Variable and Constant
These are data containers
Use Let name = 'your_choice';
if you reassign a value to your variable later you dont need to reuse let
Use Const: should be used more often
You cant reuse a Const

Use camelCase for variable name userName
You can use digits, $, underscores at the beginning
Dont use snake_case (as in ruby)
cant use variable name starting with digits e.g. 2name
cant use other special characters besides _ $
can use let variable name

Operators are syntax features that let you manipulate values e.g. +-*/. also % (returns remainder) ** (exponentation), = (assingment Operator)

Data types
numbers e.g. 2, -3, 22.2342529(FLOATS)
strings 'hi', 'hello'

plus works in js for combinining strings too

backticks `` allows for template literal with ${} syntax e.g.       `${hello}`

if you dont want white space in your string put both half of the strings into quotes and add a + operator

if you want a line break add \n to the middle of the string or a template literal

\ means that js should ignore something 

functions are 'code on demand'

you could return something in a function 

let and const have to be declared before you use them. Functions though can be defined after they have been called 

variables within a block ( {} ) cant be accesed outside of the block while variables outside a block can be accessed inside. FUnctions have access to what is around them.

Shadowed variable is when you reuse a variable name within a function. The function assumes the variable of the locally defined variable by default unless it is forced to understand the value of the globally defined one. 

Nothing gets excecuted after a return statement. you cant have a second return statment either.
